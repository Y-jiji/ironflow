# Naming Policy

The file/directory prefixed with "_" means their contents can be referred as if in their parent module. 

# Project Structure

The cuda operators are written as `*.cu` file in `./cusrc` directory. 
- in our build script, these files are compiled into `*.ptx` files
- `{name}.ptx` file corresponding to `{name}.cu` lives in `OUT_DIR/ptx`, where OUT_DIR is an environment variable automatically generated by cargo
- these `*.ptx` files are included as constant strings and then used as functions in cuda module

# Where `async` is used
